- unicode issues:

  - reading files, see https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rospkg/pull/54
    but I think for files we should use
    always utf-8. for console I/O I'm not sure

- In docstrings, decide how to refer to str/unicode. Possibly it is best
  to stick with how things are in py3 for docstrings (i.e. use `str`)

- In docstrings, use ``foo`` for values / expressions, and :class:`foo`,
  :exc:`foo`, :meth:`foo.bar` etc more consistently
